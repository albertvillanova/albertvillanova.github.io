<p>Previously, GitHub only allowed <strong>user/project sites</strong> to set the repository default branch as their publishing source.
This was the main reason why <strong>fastpages</strong> could not be used to create user/project sites, as its automation deployment uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch instead.</p>

<p>But now this is no longer the case: you can set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch as the publishing source for your user/organization site.</p>

<p>Thus, <strong>fastpages can be used to create user/organization sites</strong>.</p>

<p>I have made a <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages/pull/456">Pull Request</a> to adapt the fastpages setup for user/organization sites.
Once it will be merged, fastpages support for user/organization sites will be official.</p>
